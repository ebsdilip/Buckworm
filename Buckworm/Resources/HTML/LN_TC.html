<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Description of the service</p>
<p class="p2">The Linkable Networks Service is an online application that enables promotional offers for discounts and rebates ("Offers") made primarily by third parties ("Merchants") to be linked to your existing credit cards, debit cards or other payment accounts, as applicable (collectively your "Payment Card"). When you use a Payment Card that you have linked to an Offer to purchase the item promoted by the Offer, your use of the Linkable Networks Service will enable you to receive the value of the Offer from the Merchant.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Limitations on use</p>
<p class="p2">You must be at least 18 years old to use the Linkable Networks Service. If you are not 18, you are not permitted to use the Linkable Networks Service.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Registration</p>
<p class="p2">In order to use the Linkable Networks Service, you are required to register with us and provide us with certain information. You, the end user, agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and you agree to not misrepresent your identity or your account information. You agree to keep your Linkable Networks account information up to date and accurate, and to maintain a card registered with Linkable Networks for the redemption of an Offer.

Your registration, and this Agreement, are personal to you, and are not transferable by you to any third party without the prior written consent of Linkable Networks.

If you fail to maintain the Payment Card THAT IS LINKED TO AN OFFER UNTIL THE OFFER IS REDEEMED AND SETTLED, YOU WILL FORFEIT THE BENEFITS OF THE OFFER.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Offer Linking and Confirmation</p>
<p class="p2">The Linkable Networks Service will allow you to link Offers to your Payment Card. The linking process is initiated by your selecting an Offer to be linked to a Payment Card. The selection process will vary based on the Offer medium. In all instances, Linkable Networks will send you an email or other electronic communication confirming that the selected Offer has been linked to your Payment Card. Please note than an Offer is not linked until you receive confirmation. Once you receive confirmation, you will receive the benefit of the Offer when our systems or those of the applicable Payment Services Provider (as defined below) identify a purchase that complies with the Offer requirements, unless you subsequently opt out of the Offer, and if the Merchant has complied with its obligations to fulfill the Offer.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Offer Terms and Conditions</p>
<p class="p2">Offers will be subject to additional terms and conditions that are specific to the Offer. The Offer terms and conditions will be available to you by inclusion in, or hyperlink reference to, such terms and conditions in the advertisement or email that promotes the Offer (or as part of the Offer confirmation email), and such terms and conditions also will form part of this Agreement. Such terms and conditions may specify, without limitation: the identity of the Merchant(s) honoring the Offer; the value of the Offer; the number of times the Offer may be redeemed; the date and time on which the Offer expires; any merchandise and/or services excluded from the Offer; or that an Offer that may only be used with a specific Payment Card issuer. Copying, tampering with, altering, selling or otherwise dealing in any Offer is prohibited. Any fraudulent use of any Offer or use of the Offer in violation of this Agreement or the terms and conditions specific to the Offer renders the Offer void. Offers are void to the extent prohibited by law. Unless expressly allowed by the Merchant, Offers cannot be combined with any other offers, vouchers, certificates or promotions that may be offered by the Merchant. If you accept any Offer, then you are also expressly agreeing to be subject to the terms and conditions of that specific offer.</p>
<p class="p2">The Offer is specific to the Merchant that issued it, and it may not be used for the redemption of goods and services from any other Merchant. The issuing Merchant is solely responsible for all aspects of redemption of the Offer, including the quality of the goods and services, paying for or honoring the Offer, and any liabilities, injuries, losses or damages you may suffer in connection with the use or redemption of the Offer or the underlying goods or services purchased. You must comply with all applicable terms and conditions of the Offer in order to be eligible for the benefits of the Offer. Failure to satisfy the terms and conditions of an Offer will result in the forfeiture of any rights to the value of an Offer.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Offer Redemption</p>
<p class="p2">An Offer is redeemed by using the Payment Card to which an Offer has been linked to make a purchase that complies with the specific Offer terms and conditions. If the Merchant makes the Offer, the Merchant will be exclusively responsible for funding the Offer. Linkable Networks' sole responsibility is to arrange for credit of the Offer benefit to your Payment Card or to another payment mechanism authorized by you after the Merchant honors the Offer; Linkable Networks will have no liability to you in the event that any Merchant fails to honor the Offer. If you fail to maintain your Payment Card or authorize and maintain another payment mechanism, you will forfeit the benefits to the redemption of related Offers. In some circumstances, Linkable Networks itself may make the Offer to you; Linkable Networks will be responsible for funding and honoring Offers that Linkable Networks itself makes.

By way of example, Linkable Networks may have an agreement with your card issuing bank providing for the registration of your Payment Card so that the Payment Card can be linked to an Offer. Even if Linkable Networks does not have an agreement with your Payment Card issuer, it has an agreement with another Payment Services Provider so that your Payment Card still can be linked to an Offer and the Payment Services Provider can provide your transaction data to Linkable Networks. By using the Linkable Networks Service, you understand that Linkable Networks (and if applicable, a Payment Services Provider) may access third party sites only as designated by you, on your behalf, and for the sole purpose of retrieving information requested by you, and to register for accounts requested by you (in this case, registering your Payment Card for the Offers).
